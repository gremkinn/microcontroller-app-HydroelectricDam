# Hydroelectric Damn

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design & create a machine that will handle the main operations of the hydroelectric dam. The system should be able to concurrently monitor the water levels in the dam as well as produce a steady stream of electricity for use by the town nearby. Once the water level in the dam has passed a certain threshold, the program should automatically initiate a sequence to open the damâ€™s gates and allow the release of water. Once the water level has come down to or below a minimum allowable level, the system should then proceed to close the gates. While opening & closing, the program will also emit warningsin the form of light and sounds to alert those near by to stay clear. In case of any emergency, this system should allow the operator to pause & resume the opening/closing gate sequences at any time. While the program is on hold, the machine will indicate its paused status through light & sounds. Our team has also decided to include a feature where the operator can choose to vary the speed of the power generation.
